- **Test-Suggestions**: If you have an idea for a test that a GPT for a specific library and version should be able to pass, please fill an issue with our test-suggestion template.
- **Ressources**: We are always on the lookout for general ressources regarding custom GPTs. If you want your ressource to be listed, please create a pull request.
