# [latest] GPTs

**[latest] GPTs** is a family of [OpenAI GPTs](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts) that combine handcraftet ‚öíÔ∏èinstructions, helpful presets‚öôÔ∏è and condensed knowledge üß† a cutting-edge, user-centric suite of tools designed to enhance coding efficiency and accuracy.

## Introduction

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI have significantly enhanced our ability to process and utilize vast amounts of information. Tools like ChatGPT have showcased impressive adeptness in understanding programming languages, offering coding assistance, and even generating code snippets. Despite its proficiency, ChatGPT and similar models inherently face a crucial limitation: the knowledge cut-off. 
Due to the time gap between their training and deployment, these AI models often lack the most current updates and understandings of rapidly evolving programming languages, libraries, and frameworks, which is crucial for developers in fast-evolving domains like software development.

**[latest] GPTs** addresses this issue by implementing a dynamic, continuously updated knowledge base, effectively bridging the knowledge gap.

### Knowledge retrieval
All the **[latest] GPTs** are equiped with a curated knowledge file that describes all new features, breaking changes, deprecations and bug fixes of a library since the last version that the GPT-4 is literate in. 
To create these knowledge files, an **hybrid approach** is employed, combining the powers of AI with human experienceü§Ø. First AI algorithms skim through vast amounts of data to summarize key changes. Each AI-generated summary then undergoes a **human review**. This step ensures the accuracy, relevance, and comprehensiveness of the information, filtering out noise and preserving only what‚Äôs crucial.
The goal is to condense this ocean of information into a compact, potent knowledge fileü§å. This **minimizes knowledge retrieval time**, whilst empowering developers with swift, **state-of-the-art** coding asssistance. 


## Contribution Guidelines

### Reporting Issues
If one of our coding assistants has given you wrong advise or does not know about something that it should, be would deeply appreciate it if you create an detailed issue.

#### Before Reporting an Issue
- **Search Existing Issues**: Before creating a new issue, please check if it has already been reported. You can do this by searching through the existing issues in our repository.

#### How to Report an Issue
1. Create a New Issue: Go to the 'Issues' tab in our GitHub repository and click on 'New Issue'.
2. Choose the Appropriate Template: We have different templates for different types of issues (e.g., bug reports, feature requests). Please select the one that best fits your issue.
3. Fill Out the Template Completely: Provide as much information as possible. A well-documented issue is much easier for us to understand and address quickly.

#### Key Information to Include:
- **GPT Library and Version**: Always make clear which GPT and version you are talking about.
- **Steps to reproduce** If a GPT gave you wrong advice / was missing knowledge, include the exact prompt that was not properly answered. Ideally along  with a link to the conversation. 
- **Expected Behavior** Describe what you have expected. Ideally point to the **exact documentation** where the feature is described and the exact **version** that the missing feature  was introduced in. This greatly help us improve the knowledge file quickly.
- **Actual Behavior**: Explain what was wrong about the answer that the GPT provided.

#### After Reporting an Issue
- Follow-Up: Our team will review your report and may follow up with you for further information.
- Updates: Keep an eye on your issue for any updates or questions from our team.
- Resolution: We'll inform you once the issue is resolved or if there's a workaround.

#### Final Notes
Many thanks for reporting an issue or contributing otherwise to this project!
