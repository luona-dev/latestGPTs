## Introduction
Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI have significantly enhanced our ability to process and utilize vast amounts of information. Tools like ChatGPT have showcased impressive adeptness in understanding programming languages, offering coding assistance, and even generating code snippets. Despite its proficiency, ChatGPT and similar models inherently face a crucial limitation: the knowledge cut-off. 
Due to the time gap between their training and deployment, these AI models often lack the most current updates and understandings of rapidly evolving programming languages, libraries, and frameworks, which is crucial for developers in fast-evolving domains like software development.

**[latest] GPTs** addresses this issue by implementing a dynamic, continuously updated knowledge base, effectively bridging the knowledge gap.

## Available [latest] GPTs

- [Vue.js GPTs](/gpts/vuejs/)
- [FastAPI GPTs](/gpts/fastapi/)


### Knowledge retrieval
All the **[latest] GPTs** are equiped with a curated knowledge file that describes all new features, breaking changes, deprecations and bug fixes of a library since the last version that the GPT-4 is literate in. 
To create these knowledge files, an **hybrid approach** is employed, combining the powers of AI with human experienceü§Ø. First AI algorithms skim through vast amounts of data to summarize key changes. Each AI-generated summary then undergoes a **human review**. This step ensures the accuracy, relevance, and comprehensiveness of the information, filtering out noise and preserving only what‚Äôs crucial.
The goal is to condense this ocean of information into a compact, potent knowledge fileü§å. This **minimizes knowledge retrieval time**, whilst empowering developers with swift, **state-of-the-art** coding asssistance.
