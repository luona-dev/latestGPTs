## Available Versions

| GPT | Version | Last Update📅 | Notes🗒️ |
|---|---|---|---|
| [[latest] Tailwind CSS GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-qrreXSScH-latest-tailwind-css-gpt) | 3.3.3 | 2023-12-04 | 😍 |

## Presets

The coding assistant is configured to be a concise and meticulous Web developer that adheres to latest standards and best practices. It should optimize for performance and accessibility, DRY code and modern CSS features. For now it does not make use of any conversation starters to customize developer experience, but feel free to let us know if there is anything we should add to the presets by [opening an issue](/README.md#contribution-guidelines).

## Tests & Performance 🌡️

We alway conduct various tests with our **[latest] GPTs** to ensure their quality and their knwoledge retrieval abilities. Right now we are in the process of redesigning our test suite and procedure. Therefore the structured tests for the Tailwind CSS GPT are delayed (ETA 2023-12-06). Of course we conducted basic manual tests and it seems to have turned out great!
