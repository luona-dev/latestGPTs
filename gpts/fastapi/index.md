Custom GPT coding assistants, equiped with knowledge of the latest FastAPI features and smart presets. 

## Available Versions

| GPT | Version | Last Update📅 | Notes🗒️ |
|---|---|---|---|
| [[latest]FastAPI GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-BhYCAfVXk-latest-fastapi-gpt) | 0.104.0 | 2023-11-22 | 😍 |
| [[l]FastAPI GPT- plain](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-UXYVWTbat-latest-fastapi-gpt-plain) | ✖️ | 2023-11-22 | for testing purposes only |

## Presets

The coding assistant is a concise and meticulous Python developer that adheres to latest standards and best practices.
It should make excessive use of type hints and annotations. It is told to use Pydantic v2 features and sqlalchemy 2.0 with the new Typing API.
If you do not like these settings, or there are any other presets that you find yourself using over and over again, please let us know, by [opening an issue](/README.md#contribution-guidelines).

## Tests & Performance 🌡️

We want to create a comprehensive test suite for the **[latest] GPTs** to ensure their quality and their knwoledge retrieval abilities.
The tests are sorted by version and focus on specific features/deprecations that came with that version. Each test consists of a tasks, that an up-to-date Vue.js coding assistant should master. [Contributions](/README.md#contribution-guidelines) are very welcome!

As a comparison, each test is also conducted with "plain GPT" a GPT that has the same instructions as our **[latest] GPT** but no access to a knowledge file.

### Version 0.89.0

#### 🧪 return type annotations to declare the response_model

- **Prompt:** `Can OpenAPI deduce the response_model from the return type annotation?`
- **Difficulty:** 🟢 Easy
- **Expected Outcome:** `Yes + a short explanation of the functionality`

**Results:**

| Version | Pass | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| latest | ✅ |   |
| plain GPT | ❌ |   |

- **Prompt:** `Show me an example route that returns a object of type Item(BaseModel).`
- **Difficulty:** 🔴 Hard
- **Expected Outcome:** `The usage of a return type annotation instead of using the response_model parameter`

**Results:**

| Version | Pass | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| latest | ❌ | Often suggests to use a return type, but it semms random and unfounded.  |
| plain GPT | ❌ |   |

### Version 0.93.0

#### 🧪 lifespan async context managers

- **Prompt:** `I have some heavy computation to do once for my entire application. How can I do that?`
- **Difficulty:** 🟡 Medium

**Results:**

| Version | Pass | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| latest | ✅ |   |
| plain GPT | ❌ |   |

### Version 0.95.0

#### 🧪 Usage of Annotated

**Results:**

| Version | Pass | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| latest | ✅ |   |
| plain GPT | ❌ |   |

### Version 0.100.0

#### 🧪 Usage of model_config instead of class `Config` in pydantic models

- **Prompt:** `How can I add an example to use with OpenAPI for my Pydantic model?`
- **Difficulty:** 🟢 Easy
- **Expected Outcome:** `usage of a model_config dictionary instead of a class Config`

**Results:**

| Version | Pass | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| latest | ✅ |   |
| plain GPT | ❌ |   |

### Version 0.101.0

#### 🧪 Usage of computed_field in pydantic models

- **Prompt:** `How can I add a computed field to my Pydantic model?`
- **Difficulty:** 🟢 Easy
- **Expected Outcome:** `usage of the computed_field decorator`

**Results:**

| Version | Pass | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| latest | ✅ |   |
| plain GPT | ❌ |   |


- **Prompt:** `I need a Pydantic model with a field that is based on another field. It is fairly computationally heavy. How can I do that?`
- **Difficulty:** 🟡 Medium
- **Expected Outcome:** `usage of the computed_field decorator`

**Results:**

| Version | Pass | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| latest | ✅ |   |
